# PathfindingVisualizer
Desktop app created in C++, used for visualizing 5 different pathfinding algorithms on a grid.

I took on creating this app as a challenge for myself, to become comfortable with OpenGL, SFML, the different algorithms and the workflow of such a project.
Feel free to look at the code, take inspiration from it, correct the mistakes you catch of improve what you consider suited.

Special thanks to Clement Mihailescu for giving me the idea.
